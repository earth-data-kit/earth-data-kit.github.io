Getting Started
===============

Prerequisites
-------------
Before using Earth Data Kit, ensure that the following are installed:

- Python 3.12 or newer
- GDAL 3.10 or above - https://gdal.org/en/stable/download.html#binaries
- s5cmd - https://github.com/peak/s5cmd

Installation
------------
To install Earth Data Kit, follow these steps:

1. Download the latest release from the official GitHub releases page:
   
   - https://github.com/earth-data-kit/earth-data-kit/releases

2. After downloading the tarball, install the package using pip. For example, within your virtual environment execute:

   .. code-block:: console

      (.venv) $ wget https://github.com/siddhantgupta3/earth-data-kit/releases/download/1.0.0a1/earth_data_kit-1.0.0a1.tar.gz 
      (.venv) $ pip3 install earth_data_kit-1.0.0a1.tar.gz

Environment Configuration
-------------------------
Earth Data Kit can be customized via environment variables. This approach lets you easily configure settings such as AWS credentials, GDAL options, and other operational parameters. You can maintain these settings in a ``.env`` file and load them using the ``python-dotenv`` package.

General Options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* ``TMP_DIR`` *(Required)*: The directory path used for storing temporary files (e.g., catalog, pre-processed VRTs).

AWS Options
~~~~~~~~~~~
* ``AWS_REGION``: Specifies the AWS region to use (e.g., us-west-2).
* ``AWS_NO_SIGN_REQUEST`` (YES/NO): If set to YES, this option disables request signing, meaning AWS credentials will be bypassed.
* ``AWS_REQUEST_PAYER`` (requester): Indicates that the requester accepts any charges that may result from the request. Use this when accessing buckets that require payer confirmation.

Google Earth Engine Options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* ``GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS``: Specifies the path to the JSON credentials file for authenticating with the Earth Engine API.

GDAL Options
~~~~~~~~~~~~
* ``GDAL_HTTP_TCP_KEEPALIVE`` (YES/NO): Determines whether to enable TCP keep-alive for GDAL HTTP connections (defaults to NO).

This configuration setup provides flexibility to adapt Earth Data Kit to your specific environment and processing needs.
